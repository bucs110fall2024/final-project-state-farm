## Project Description

My project consists of a ship sprite which is controlled by the player, with the goal of avoiding the falling space rocks and make it out of their own personal 'meteor storm'. The player gains points by surviving, but the asteroids fall faster and more frequently as time progresses. The game ends when the player is hit.
